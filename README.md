# There are 2 caeser cyphers here:
#One that is just lower case ASCII but is less secure
#The other is all the ASCII characters and is more secure
#They can both encrypt and dcrypt a message just so
#long as you know the key(You will create this when encrypting.)
#I tried to write it in as little code as possible to make it more effecient.
